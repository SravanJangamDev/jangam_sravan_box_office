# üéüÔ∏è Jangam Sravan's Box Office

A minimal FastAPI-based ticket booking system that supports:
- Event creation with total seats
- Temporary seat holds with TTL
- Booking confirmation with idempotency
- Partial fulfillment policy
- Metrics on events, holds, bookings, and expiries (optional bonus)

## üì¶ Key Modules

### 1. **API Endpoints**
- `POST /events` ‚Üí Create an event (`name`, `total_seats`)
- `POST /holds` ‚Üí Request temporary seat hold (`event_id`, `qty`, `ttl`)
- `POST /book` ‚Üí Confirm booking with an active hold (`hold_id`, `payment_token`)
- `GET /events/{id}` ‚Üí Get snapshot of event state (`total`, `available`, `held`, `booked`)
- `GET /metrics` ‚Üí Monitoring endpoint: totals, active holds, bookings, expiries

### 2. **Concurrency Control**
- Uses **`asyncio.Lock`** (for async FastAPI) to prevent oversubscription when multiple concurrent hold/booking requests occur.
- Critical sections:
  - ticket availability check
  - Hold creation
  - Booking confirmation

### 3. **Background Worker**
- A **background task** runs every few seconds to:
  - Scan active holds
  - Expire holds past their `expires_at`
  - Return seats back to `available`

### 4. **Idempotency**
- Each booking request requires `{hold_id, payment_token}`.
- Bookings are idempotent:
  - If retried with same `hold_id` and `payment_token`, it returns the same `booking_id`.
  - Prevents double-booking due to network retries.

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Model

In-memory Python dicts (can be swapped with DB later):

```python
events = {
  event_id: {
    "name": str,
    "total_seats": int,
    "available": int,
    "held": int,
    "booked": int,
    "created_at": datetime
  }
}

holds = {
  hold_id: {
    "event_id": str,
    "qty": int,
    "expires_at": datetime,
    "payment_token": str,
    "status": "active" | "expired" | "booked"
  }
}

bookings = {
  booking_id: {
    "event_id": str,
    "hold_id": str,
    "qty": int,
    "created_at": datetime
  }
}

```
